# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Operation-scoped RDMA staging

- Large scalar and scatter/gather PUTs negotiate exact operation-scoped
  staging leases. Successful STORE revokes the remote MR before recycling
  storage; failed connections keep storage until QP/MR teardown completes.
- Direct scalar/SG GETs negotiate dynamic pull descriptors and explicitly
  acknowledge release after local READ completions. Supported endpoints no
  longer reserve a connection-lifetime pull arena.
- `DFKV_RDMA_MAX_BLOCK_BYTES` remains the common PUT/GET object ceiling.
  `DFKV_RDMA_INLINE_PUT_MAX_BYTES` defaults to 4 MiB (0 disables leased PUT);
  `DFKV_RDMA_DYNAMIC_PULL` defaults to enabled (0 retains legacy pull).
  Both capabilities are optional and negotiated before connection sizing.
- Preserve mixed-batch invalid results and first-write-wins ordering; reuse
  pooled legacy endpoints without repeated capability-probe/QP churn.
  Insufficient GET capacity returns `kInvalid` without cooling a healthy peer.
- Add delayed-DMA, MR/chunk reclamation, pressure, generation, old-peer and
  posted-READ abandonment regressions. Hardware CI invokes the lease suites
  in SYNC/io_uring and TSan modes and distinguishes skipped hardware probes.
- Replace the in-process memory benchmark with an external-server client:
  retain clients during idle sampling, record sampled server RSS/committed/
  leased peaks, and validate every successful PUT with byte-exact GET.
  Samples are not exact hardware high-water counters.

### Hybrid inference cache correctness

- Revalidate vLLM's length-dependent state mask after shortening a lookup
  prefix, and reserve the sampling tail before lookup rather than truncating
  an already validated hit.
- Preserve each cache group's effective physical block coverage instead of
  treating a small attention block as a whole scheduler-LCM region. Respect
  nonpersistent scratch pools without forcing them into the hash geometry.
- Store every TP-sharded recurrent checkpoint under its physical rank in the
  `mamba` pool; retain attention replica striping without eliding required
  state-shard clients. Old collapsed state keys and affected underfilled
  heterogeneous layouts cold-miss after the identity correction; native wire,
  raw payload and C ABI formats remain compatible.
- Include the tested SGLang engine patch registering the missing DSA indexer
  sidecar in hybrid Mamba stacks. Correct recurrent bytes alone do not make a
  complete DSA cache; the indexer must survive the same fresh-process reload.


### SGLang Prefill-CP storage identity and physical rail affinity

- Fixed SGLang DP-attention rail affinity to use the world-group node-local
  process rank instead of TP/PCP coordinates. Eight TP-of-1 schedulers no
  longer collapse onto rail 0; missing physical rank now fails startup.
- Added the explicit `prefill_cp_storage_layout=replicated` contract for
  rank-replicated MLA Prefill-CP. All CP readers retain the deployed CP size but
  address the elected writer's `pcp_rank=0` key. DCP, DSA cache-layer split,
  sharded, and ambiguous layouts fail closed.
- Added HiCache parallel-identity and contiguous-prefix existence metrics, plus
  native per-rail successful logical PUT/GET operation and payload-byte
  counters.
- Fixed three latent device-direct backup branches that referenced an
  uninitialized page count/component count, and refreshed the CPU-only vLLM
  test shims for the current world-group and asynchronous-load contracts.

### RDMA receive-pool default capacity

- Raised the default `DFKV_RDMA_RECV_SEGMENT_SIZE` hard budget from 16 GiB to
  128 GiB. The receive pool remains lazy: startup commits only the initial
  256 MiB chunk, so the larger default expands the growth ceiling without
  eagerly pinning or registering 128 GiB. Explicit operator overrides are
  unchanged.

### vLLM long-context node-dedup load windows

- Added opt-in `load_window_keys` and `load_window_min_keys` connector settings.
  Large replicated loads can now publish bounded native GET results before the
  same-host GPU dedup wait deadline, while short requests retain one native GET.
- Defaults remain disabled. Values are validated at startup, preserve key/result
  order, and retain one outer connector metric for the logical load.
- On xb01-0064, a 1,000,000-token TP8 GLM-5.3 hot load with 128-key windows
  reduced TTFT from 39.35 s to 22.92 s and reduced native remote fetches from
  approximately eight copies to one, with zero dedup fallback. A 4,096-key
  threshold kept the 65,536-token/C10 path unwindowed at 35,622 total tok/s.

### Adaptive RDMA receive capacity and bounded high-water reclaim

- Replaced the eagerly committed monolithic RDMA receive segment with a lazy
  chunk pool. `DFKV_RDMA_RECV_SEGMENT_SIZE` remains the hard process budget;
  `DFKV_RDMA_RECV_CHUNK_BYTES` (default 256 MiB) controls incremental commits.
  Each connection publishes and registers only the chunk containing its lease.
- Decoupled `DFKV_RDMA_MAX_BLOCK_BYTES` from physical connection geometry. It
  remains the logical safety ceiling, while data QPs now negotiate a
  power-of-two class sized to the current operation, with
  `DFKV_RDMA_CONNECTION_MIN_BLOCK_BYTES` (default 256 KiB) as the floor.
- Idle endpoint reuse selects the smallest sufficient class, and a full idle
  pool prefers a smaller returning QP over its largest retained QP.
- Extended adaptive geometry to QP depth: scalar operations open depth-1 QPs,
  while batched operations select the smallest sufficient power-of-two depth.
  Pool reuse and resource accounting now match both block and depth classes,
  with bounded per-class opened/active/idle metrics.
- Replaced per-connection pull-read MR registration with type-2 Memory Windows
  over shared per-PD chunk MRs. Hardware without Memory Window support retains
  the exact-range MR fallback and exposes which path each connection used.
- Affinitized growth chunks to their first rail/NUMA node, and added idle
  shrinking for empty non-initial chunks (`DFKV_RDMA_RECV_CHUNK_IDLE_MS`,
  default 60 s). The initial shared chunk is never released.
- Changed watermark eviction to a persistent high/low hysteresis drain bounded
  by `DFKV_SLAB_EVICT_MAX_EXTENTS_PER_TICK` (default one). Whole extents clear
  `slots.tbl` in one contiguous write instead of one 64-byte pwrite per slot.
- Added receive-pool growth/shrink/budget, pull Memory Window/fallback,
  adaptive connection-class, and watermark active/tick/duration/clear metrics.
- Reused one preallocated zero-record buffer for extent metadata clears,
  removing allocation and repeated zero-fill work from the watermark lock.
- Completed vLLM replicated-MLA rank convergence: converged client-rank mode
  automatically enables native same-host GPU rendezvous, so one rank performs
  each remote GET and CUDA IPC publishes identical bytes to TP followers.
- On xb01-0064, 80 live 1 MiB data QPs under a 64 MiB logical ceiling used
  674 MiB across three lazy chunks and completed 10,000/10,000 PUTs; v2.23.3's
  fixed geometry exhausted an 8 GiB segment at roughly 15 such QPs. Sustained
  64 GiB high-water PUT improved from 5.39 to 6.71 GB/s, p99 from 63.8 to
  24.1 ms, and max latency from 496.8 to 50.8 ms.

### vLLM hybrid state and explicit TCP staging

- Accepted align-mode hybrid cache groups whose Mamba block size differs from
  the attention cache block size. The connector already resolves the scheduler
  LCM and preserves each group's physical block geometry; the old equality
  gate incorrectly rejected Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`400` vs `4`) at startup.
- Added opt-in `require_rdma=false` for the vLLM connector. The default remains
  fail-closed GPUDirect RDMA; the opt-in path uses libdfkv's bounded host
  staging plus final CUDA publication and enables a correctness-first fallback
  when a platform's inbound GPUDirect GET path is unusable.

### LMCache rank-local rail affinity

- Added opt-in `rail_affinity` and `rail_affinity_fallbacks` plugin settings to
  the in-process LMCache dfkv connector. Each worker now uses LMCache's explicit
  per-host `local_worker_id` to apply the shared primary/fallback policy before
  opening the native client; missing or invalid local metadata fails closed.
- Kept the MP-server L2 adapter unchanged because it owns one shared dfkv
  client and has no single physical GPU rank at construction.

### vLLM rank-local rail affinity

- Added `rail_affinity` and `rail_affinity_fallbacks` to
  `DfkvStoreConnector`. Before opening the native client, each vLLM worker now
  maps its world-group local rank to one primary plus a bounded ordered
  fallback set, then sets `DFKV_RDMA_DEV`, `DFKV_RDMA_PRIMARY_DEV`, and
  `DFKV_RDMA_NUMA=0`.
- Moved the rail-list parsing, fallback bounds, duplicate rejection, and
  environment update contract into `dfkv-common`; SGLang HiCache and vLLM now
  share one implementation while retaining their framework-specific physical
  rank resolution.

### RDMA connection capacity

- Unified scalar and scatter-gather data operations on one exclusive-ownership
  endpoint pool. Control operations remain isolated. Ring autoscaling now sizes
  `nodes × 2 pools × max(pool limit, rails) × 1.25`.
- Lowered the per-peer/pool idle default from 16 to 8: seven process-wide read
  workers plus one warm spare avoid reconnect churn, while a cap of four is
  proven to reopen three endpoints under a seven-way concurrent wave.
- With 4 MiB blocks and depth four, one pull data connection leases
  33,587,200 bytes. The xb01 14×TP8, per-pool-limit-8 envelope is 896 data plus
  896 smaller control connections per server. Including 25% churn consumes
  37,984,665,600 bytes (35.4 GiB), so xb01's 64 GiB setting remains sufficient;
  increasing it to 128 GiB is unnecessary.
- On xb01-gpu-200b-0064, 64 GiB and 128 GiB segments both registered on
  `ib7s400p6` with zero allocation failures. Readiness took 21 s and 43 s
  respectively, so 128 GiB doubles the pinned MR and adds 22 s startup latency
  without serving the current capacity envelope.
- Added client idle/active pool gauges by operation lane and rail, live
  connection gauges by peer and local rail, and the pool limit. Added server
  receive-segment used/free/largest-range, allocation-failure, pull/legacy
  connection, and data/control leased-byte metrics.
- `rail_affinity=true` now assigns each rank one primary plus one ordered
  neighboring fallback HCA by default. `rail_affinity_fallbacks=0` restores
  strict one-rank/one-rail binding; larger values remain bounded by the
  configured HCA list.

### Metrics HTTP clean close

- Consume the complete HTTP request-head section, bounded to 32 KiB and by the
  existing accept-time absolute deadline, before rendering server or MDS
  metrics. Closing no longer leaves unread Prometheus headers that force Linux
  to send a TCP RST and truncate large remote scrapes.
- Preserve the existing one-request connection model, connection cap,
  slow-drip protection, health/readiness semantics, and send timeout. Successful
  responses now finish with an explicit write-side shutdown and clean EOF.
- Add realistic Prometheus headers, a 256 KiB byte-exact response, clean-EOF,
  split-header, header-drip, and oversized unterminated-header regressions.

### CUDA GET pinned publication pool

- Replaced per-operation CUDA host registration for GET publication with a
  process-wide, bounded, reusable portable-pinned bounce pool. Slots are fixed
  size, allocated and pinned/registered once on first use, exclusively leased,
  and returned only after the stream-ordered host-to-device copy synchronizes.
- Added `DFKV_CUDA_PINNED_POOL_BYTES` (default 67108864, 64 MiB; maximum
  4 GiB) and `DFKV_CUDA_PINNED_SLOT_BYTES` (default 4194304, 4 MiB; accepted
  range 4 KiB–64 MiB). Values are positive decimal byte counts; the budget
  rounds down to whole slots with at least one and at most 4096 slots. Invalid
  sizing warns and falls back to both defaults. Allocation is lazy, so
  pinned-memory and memlock consumption grows only to the concurrent high-water
  and remains bounded by that rounded per-process budget.
- When every slot is leased and the budget is exhausted, CUDA GET publication
  blocks until a slot is returned rather than allocating beyond the bound.
  Payloads larger than one slot are published in fixed-size chunks.
- Kept RDMA retry data in operation-owned pageable staging. Only the final
  winning attempt is copied through the pinned pool to caller CUDA memory, so a
  failed rail cannot partially publish into the caller buffer. Direct
  GPUDirect GET would violate that retry fence; GPUDirect PUT remains unchanged.
- CUDA context preservation, multi-device publication, byte-exact mixed
  scatter-gather behavior, synchronous completion, fail-closed CUDA errors,
  parent-process teardown, and fail-closed post-fork child behavior are
  preserved. A slot whose stream synchronization fails is quarantined and kept
  pinned until process exit rather than risking release while the driver may
  still reference it. Deployments must provision `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` for the
  pool's lazy high-water plus other locked memory.

## v2.19.0 — 2026-08-13

### CUDA GET correctness

- Fixed a `RangeInto`/`RangeIntoMulti` failure in which the host publication
  path could call `memcpy` with a CUDA device destination and terminate the
  process with `SIGSEGV`.
- Added an explicit destination kind to range reads. CUDA GETs now receive RDMA
  data into operation-owned pinned host staging and publish it with asynchronous
  host-to-device copies only after the final healthy rail attempt succeeds.
  Completion remains synchronous: the call returns success only after the CUDA
  stream has completed publication.
- Applied the same publication and retry fence to contiguous ranges, mixed
  host/CUDA scatter-gather ranges, and rail retry, so a failed attempt cannot
  publish partial CUDA data before a later attempt succeeds.
- PUT and memory-registration behavior are unchanged and remain GPUDirect.
  CUDA GET adds temporary pinned host memory, a host-to-device copy, stream
  synchronization, and associated allocation/registration overhead. This is a
  known performance tradeoff pending safe direct-GPU retry fencing; deployments
  should validate pinned-memory and memlock capacity for their concurrent GET
  payload.

## v2.11.1 — 2026-08-10

### Release

- Corrected the tag workflow to keep the generic no-HCA release runner from
  executing hardware-only `RdmaLoopback.*` tests. RDMA remains gated by the
  dedicated compile and probe-gated Soft-RoCE CI jobs and by qualification on
  real RDMA hardware.
- Require every release tag commit to be reachable from `origin/main`.
- The immutable `v2.11.0` tag published no release assets because its generic
  runner attempted those hardware-only tests; v2.11.1 supersedes that failed
  publication attempt without data-path behavior changes.

## v2.11.0 — 2026-08-09

### Observability

- Added one bounded native `KVClient` snapshot covering operation, peer health,
  ring/MDS, RDMA rail/CQ/MR/timeout, TCP pool, and same-host dedup state.
- Mirrored the same native allowlist into SGLang HiCache and vLLM Prometheus
  endpoints without adding work to the transfer request path.
- Added opt-in connector-fleet OTLP push for SGLang HiCache, LMCache, and vLLM,
  with stable connector, host, rank, model, deployment, connector-package, and
  native-library identity.
- Added explicit last-good poll health (`success`, failure count, last-success
  time) so snapshot failures cannot masquerade as healthy zero traffic.
- Added MDS per-operation etcd request/error/latency metrics, MDS readiness,
  consumer counts, group capacity/hit/version/stats aggregates, and server
  startup/readiness/health gauges.
- Added bounded per-rail server and client traffic/error series, receive-segment
  capacity, io_uring activation/fallback, storage engine, RAM-tier, slab
  allocator/rebuild, and TCP pool/backoff diagnostics.
- Expanded the provisioned Grafana connector and cluster dashboards with
  readiness, poll freshness, empty-ring/MDS state, dedup, transport failures,
  receive-segment, rail bandwidth/errors, group capacity/hit ratio, and etcd
  latency views.
- Added Prometheus alert rules for server/MDS readiness, storage health, etcd
  errors, version skew, missing heartbeat stats, RDMA failures/capacity,
  connector poll staleness, empty rings, MDS reachability, TCP backoff, and
  dedup rendezvous timeouts.
- Corrected the default zero-dependency exporter contract: it sends OTLP/HTTP
  JSON to the HTTP receiver (normally port 4318); port 4317 is only for an
  explicitly selected OpenTelemetry SDK gRPC exporter.
- Made connector telemetry lifecycle-safe: process-shared recorders are reference
  counted, final metrics/traces flush on the last close, failed exports preserve
  window maxima and uncommitted native counter deltas, and constructor failures
  release native handles and telemetry acquisitions.
- Made one scrape-time MDS group range serve both readiness and aggregation;
  scrape traffic is separately labeled `op="metrics_range"`, and latency
  histograms now resolve bounded failures through 60 seconds.
- Added explicit missing-scrape/missing-connector alerts, bounded dashboard
  resource variables, and canonical `slot_size` slab labels.

### Operations and release

- Added `dfkvctl stat --all` health classification from stable server gauges,
  explicit handling for legacy metrics, and all-group MDS discovery/stat views.
- Added atomic operational artifacts for membership audit, load regression,
  tenant quota, and node-replacement workflows, plus GPU same-host dedup
  reproduction.
- Added a least-privilege, tag-gated GitHub Release workflow. It reruns tests,
  validates observability configuration, builds portable RDMA/io_uring binaries
  and all three connector wheels, emits SHA-256 checksums, and publishes assets
  once through a draft-to-immutable release transition.
- Made root `VERSION`, C++ binaries, and Python connector package versions a
  CI-enforced release contract.
- Tightened the install/package manifest so generated caches and local build
  artifacts are excluded while supported sources, deployment files, tests, and
  documentation remain available in the release archive.
- Hardened `dfkv_bench` as a regression gate: GET uses one up-front registered
  MR arena, setup fails closed instead of falling back to ad-hoc registration,
  goodput excludes failed operations, diagnostics expose control-plane and RDMA
  availability/errors, and both current and legacy output remain parseable.
- Release and CI now validate the runtime container end to end, preserve and
  verify versioned `libdfkv.so` SONAME symlinks, smoke-import the shipped SGLang
  and vLLM packages under Python 3.12, and verify installed wheel metadata and
  vendored telemetry contents.
- Fixed signed-integer overflow in the etcd Base64 decode accumulator; long
  membership values now remain defined under UBSan and decode byte-exactly.
- Made the RAM flush-backlog gauge include dequeued in-flight writes, closing a
  false-zero readiness window that could race the background reclaimer.
- Pinned release Actions, runtime/CI base images, and the bundled observability
  stack to reviewed immutable digests; Grafana now fails closed unless the
  operator supplies a non-default administrator password.

### Compatibility

- No data-format migration is required.
- Metrics and tracing remain opt-in. Existing deployments that do not enable a
  metrics port or connector telemetry retain their prior data-path behavior.
- Dashboards and alert rules target the v2.11.0 metric contract; missing series
  on older nodes indicate rollout state, not a numeric zero.
