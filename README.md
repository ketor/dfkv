# dfkv — distributed KV cache for LLM inference (SGLang · LMCache · vLLM)

[![CI](https://github.com/dingodb/dfkv/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dingodb/dfkv/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A small, **self-contained** distributed key-value cache that pools GPU-node NVMe
SSDs into a shared, large-capacity KV pool for LLM inference (e.g. GLM-5.1 / MLA,
DeepSeek-V4), **without any DingoFS / brpc / S3-RADOS dependency** — it runs on
its own (only its built-in MDS + etcd for dynamic membership). It plugs into
three engines through thin adapters over one portable core:

- **SGLang HiCache** as an L3 external KV store (`--hicache-storage-backend dynamic`).
- **LMCache** as a `RemoteConnector`.
- **vLLM** directly as a `KVConnectorBase_V1` (GPUDirect RDMA, no LMCache).

> Origin: extracted from the DingoFS branch `feat/kvcache-sglang`
> (`src/cache/kvclient`). The portable core has zero coupling to DingoFS, so it
> lives here as an independent repo. To instead fuse these semantics into the
> production `dingo-cache` (brpc + MDS), see `docs/INTEGRATION.md`.

## What it is
- **`dfkv_server`** — a cache-node daemon. Disk + bounded eviction,
  **cache-only** (a miss is a clean NotFound; no object-store fallback),
  synchronous durable-visible writes. Supports **multiple NVMe SSDs per node**
  (`--dir d1,d2,d3`, intra-node Ketama). With `--mds`, `--group`, `--id`,
  `--advertise`, `--weight` it registers into the MDS tier. With neither a
  `--store-engine` option nor `DFKV_STORE_ENGINE`, every server/store path
  selects the restart-safe slab backend. `file` remains an explicit
  diagnostic/rollback choice; invalid slab capacity/geometry refuses startup
  rather than falling back. An optional write-through **RAM hot tier**
  (`DFKV_RAM_TIER=1`) serves registered-memory hits without disk I/O — see
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **`dfkv_mds`** — stateless Membership Directory Service daemon. Flags:
  `--listen <port>` and `--etcd <host:port>` (default `127.0.0.1:2379`). The only
  etcd client in the system; holds each node's etcd lease on its behalf. Deploy as
  N replicas — no load-balancer needed; nodes and clients each pick any reachable
  MDS and fail over automatically.
- **`libdfkv.so`** — C ABI client (canonical namespace + object-key hashing,
  Ketama routing, opaque raw-value Put/Get/Exist).
- **`integration/hicache/dfkv_hicache.py`** — SGLang `HiCacheStorage` plugin loaded via
  `--hicache-storage-backend dynamic` (no SGLang fork). MLA: one packed-latent
  object per page, no tp_rank suffix, `backup_skip` (only tp_rank 0 writes).

## Design in one breath
SGLang HiCache (zero-copy `interface_v1`) → `dfkv_hicache.py` (ctypes) →
`libdfkv` v2 client (length-framed namespace/object identity + Ketama route) →
TCP/RDMA → `dfkv_server` → optional RAM hot tier → DiskCacheGroup over N NVMe
(production slab extents; explicit file fallback).
Distributed = client-side consistent hashing; no replication (regenerable KV →
node loss = miss → recompute). Full architecture: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Membership** is managed by the MDS tier (`dfkv_mds` + etcd). Nodes register
with the MDS on startup and send periodic heartbeats; etcd leases (TTL 30 s)
are the liveness signal. Native clients use the single immutable
`dfkv_client_options_v2` constructor: set either static `members` or
`mds_endpoints` + `mds_group`. MDS mode polls the directory and rebuilds the
weighted consistent-hash ring whenever its epoch advances. Two-layer offline
detection: **layer-2** — etcd lease expiry → MDS view changes → client epoch →
ring rebuild (authoritative removal, ≤ 30 s); **layer-1** — `PeerHealth` fast
avoidance short-circuits transport failures to misses during a cooldown. There
is no post-open membership mutation API in v2. For rings still running v1.x
nodes/clients, `DFKV_MDS_ACCEPT_LEGACY=1` enables a dual-protocol shim on the
MDS control plane (ring-level isolation still applies) — see
`docs/DEPLOY.md` §2b.

**Client registration** (who is using dfkv): cache *consumers* (inference
connector instances — vLLM / LMCache / SGLang HiCache) register themselves with
the MDS under a disjoint etcd prefix (`/dfkv/v1/groups/<g>/clients/<id>`) so
they never enter the placement ring. The same lease/heartbeat contract as nodes
applies — a dead connector's key expires out of etcd within the TTL, no explicit
deregister, no stale keys. Connectors set
`DFKV_CLIENT_OPT_REGISTER_WITH_MDS`, `client_id`, `client_info`, and heartbeat
fields in `dfkv_client_options_v2` when MDS discovery is used (opt out with
`DFKV_CLIENT_REGISTER=0`).
Observe with `dfkvctl clients --mds <ep,...> --group <g>` or the
`dfkv_mds_group_clients` gauge. Only upgraded clients register, so an empty list
means "none of the current consumers are registered," not "no one is using dfkv."

## Build & test (no GPU / no RDMA needed)
```bash
cmake -S . -B build            # add -DDFKV_STATIC_LIBSTDCXX=ON for portable binaries
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure   # C++ gtests + the Python plugin test
```
Artifacts: `build/dfkv_server`, `build/dfkv_mds`, `build/libdfkv.so`.

## Run a cluster
```bash
# 1. Start etcd (one or three nodes, external)

# 2. Start MDS replicas (stateless, any number)
dfkv_mds --listen 9400 --etcd 127.0.0.1:2379

# 3. On each cache node (--mds requires --id and --advertise)
dfkv_server --dir /mnt/disk1/dfkv,/mnt/disk2/dfkv,/mnt/disk3/dfkv \
            --port 12000 --cap 6597069766656 \
            --mds 10.0.0.1:9400,10.0.0.2:9400 \
            --group default --id n1 --advertise 10.0.0.10:12000

# 4. Client: one immutable v2 construction descriptor (recommended MDS mode)
#    dfkv_client_options_v2 o = { ... .mds_endpoints = "10.0.0.1:9400,10.0.0.2:9400",
#                                 .mds_group = "default" };
#    dfkv_client_t c = dfkv_open_v2(&o);
# Static single-node mode sets o.members instead; no mutable follow-up calls.
```

## Observe the cluster
```bash
dfkvctl ring    --mds 10.0.0.1:9400 --group default        # cache nodes + ring share
dfkvctl clients --mds 10.0.0.1:9400 --group default        # inference consumers
dfkvctl stats   --mds 10.0.0.1:9400 --group default        # ring stats + clients=N
dfkvctl stat    --mds 10.0.0.1:9400 --group default --all  # per-node deep-dive

## Engine integrations
- **SGLang HiCache**: `integration/hicache/dfkv_hicache.py` — see `docs/CONNECTORS.md` §2
  (connect/config/use; cluster deploy is `docs/DEPLOY.md`).
- **LMCache**: `integration/lmcache/` (`dfkv_connector`) — see `docs/CONNECTORS.md` §4
  (deploy + design + implementation).
- **vLLM (direct)**: `integration/vllm/` (`dfkv_vllm`) — a `KVConnectorBase_V1`
  connector occupying the same `--kv-transfer-config` slot as `MooncakeStoreConnector`,
  storing/loading KV **directly over GPUDirect RDMA** (no LMCache, no host bounce).
  Pure-Python ctypes over `libdfkv.so`; uses the scatter-gather batch API to coalesce
  per-chunk keys. Validated on H100 + IB with DeepSeek-V4 (multi kv_cache_group / MLA +
  SWA), full cross-restart and cross-DP prefix hit. See `docs/CONNECTORS.md` §3 (config
  reference + recommended settings) and `integration/vllm/README.md`.

## Operability & performance features
- **Slab-first storage** (no flag/env required; `--store-engine=slab` may pin it
  explicitly): a fixed pool of pre-allocated extent files carved into
  deterministic size classes. Sparse `slots.tbl` metadata is rebuilt in bulk
  after restart, preserving cache warmth without directory walks, per-object
  opens, or file-per-block inode pressure. CRC-protected records, dirty-epoch
  cold reset, deferred removal, O_DIRECT payload I/O, and byte-aware eviction
  keep failures fail-closed. `--store-engine=file` is an explicit diagnostic
  fallback, not a silent recovery path or the production default.
- **RAM hot tier** (`DFKV_RAM_TIER=1`, off by default): a pre-registered arena
  fronting the disk — PUT is **write-through** (synchronously visible, async-flushed
  to disk) and a warm GET is served **straight from the arena over RDMA** (zero-copy
  scatter-send from the arena MR, no open/pread/disk), removing the disk-bound COLD
  load bottleneck. Send-in-flight slot pinning + flush backpressure keep it correct;
  `dfkv_ram_*` metrics expose hit-rate + backpressure. See
  [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) §5–6.
- **128-bit native block identity**: SHA-256 of length-framed canonical
  namespace + object-key bytes, truncated to 128 bits for wire/storage identity.
  Connector object keys are self-delimiting binary bytes encoding pool, full
  chunk hash, DP/TP/PCP/DCP/PP coordinates, cache-group/component, and optional
  scatter geometry; namespace remains separate binary identity. C ABI v2 passes
  every key as pointer + exact length (parallel arrays for batch/SG), so embedded
  NUL and non-UTF-8 bytes are preserved. Values remain opaque raw bytes with no
  hidden header or compatibility unwrap.
- **Connection pooling + keep-alive** (TCP_NODELAY): ~250× lower latency vs dial-per-call.
- **Batch APIs** with concurrent fan-out across nodes and local NVMe disks.
- **Connect/IO timeouts + stale-connection retry**: a hung node fails fast, never hangs.
- **Observability** ([docs/METRICS.md](docs/METRICS.md)): opt-in embedded Prometheus
  `/metrics` on `dfkv_server` and `dfkv_mds` (`--metrics-port`); sampled op-latency
  histogram, eviction/error/per-disk/RDMA counters server-side; client-side counters
  (peer health, IO errors) via `dfkv_stats_snapshot` + a plugin poller. **Opt-in and
  off the datapath** — no `--metrics-port` ⇒ no listener, behavior unchanged.
  The three connectors (vLLM / LMCache / SGLang HiCache) can also **push** fleet
  metrics (ops/keys/bytes, op latency, per-peer latency) over OTLP to a central
  Collector → Grafana — opt-in via `DFKV_METRICS_ENABLED=1`, **zero-dependency stdlib
  exporter by default**; see [deploy/observability/CONNECTOR-USAGE.md](deploy/observability/CONNECTOR-USAGE.md)
  and [docs/METRICS.md](docs/METRICS.md) §3.4.
  Health endpoints differ by daemon: `dfkv_server /readyz` means startup
  finished + first MDS registration done + current store/RAM health OK
  (`src/cache/dfkv_server_main.cc:389`); `dfkv_mds /healthz` is pure process
  liveness (it no longer probes etcd, avoiding CrashLoop storms), while
  `dfkv_mds /readyz` runs a TTL-debounced etcd probe
  (`DFKV_MDS_PROBE_CACHE_MS`, default 2500 ms).
- **Dynamic membership**: the immutable `dfkv_client_options_v2` descriptor
  selects MDS discovery at construction; the client polls MDS and atomically
  rebuilds its weighted Ketama ring on etcd-epoch changes. No mutable
  membership or post-open discovery API is exported.
- **CLI tools**: `dfkv_smoke` (roundtrip check), `dfkvctl` — per-node ops
  (`put/get/exist/stat`) plus cluster views: `dfkvctl ring` (membership + ring vnode
  share + each node's **self-reported version/config** — engine, capacity, RAM tier,
  RDMA dev — carried on register/heartbeat, so fleet-wide version/config audit is one
  command, no per-node ssh) and `dfkvctl stat --all` (per-node metrics + aggregate) via MDS.
- **RDMA transport v2** (gated `-DDFKV_WITH_RDMA=ON`, native libibverbs RC):
  with no device override each host chooses its first `ACTIVE` local HCA and
  sends an empty device selector to its peer. An explicit comma whitelist opts
  into multi-rail round-robin and therefore must name the intended fabric on
  both hosts. Device names are limited to 18 bytes in the wire dev frame —
  longer names fail fast instead of silently truncating (7837f0b). QPs bootstrap over a tiny TCP channel, so the data fabric needs no
  IP. A v2 capability probe is mandatory; protocol, QP, receive-segment, or
  registration mismatch rejects the connection. Unset `DFKV_RDMA` selects TCP;
  once RDMA is requested it never switches transports.
- **One-sided zero-copy data plane**: control descriptors/status use small 4-KiB
  SEND/RECV buffers. PUT payloads RDMA-WRITE into leases from one process-wide,
  pre-registered receive segment; GET payloads RDMA-WRITE directly into the
  caller's registered buffer. No connection-sized block buffers or payload copy
  are used.
- **Optional pipelining** (`DFKV_RDMA_DEPTH=K`): K requests in flight per connection.
  A network-latency hider, **not a throughput knob** — GET and PUT are both
  depth-flat (the per-connection serve loop is in-order; benchmarked GET ~1.24 GB/s at
  depth 1 == 32). The throughput levers are **multi-connection fan-out**
  (`batch_concurrency`) and **fewer/larger keys**. See `docs/datapath-perf-notes.md`.
- **NUMA-aware rail selection** (`DFKV_RDMA_NUMA=1`): with an explicit
  multi-rail whitelist, prefers an `ACTIVE` rail local to the calling thread,
  then round-robins the listed healthy rails; when every NUMA-local rail is
  inadmissible, it degrades to the full enabled rail set instead of refusing
  traffic (5ef39f1). Server threads follow their QP's
  rail NUMA node; the single shared receive segment is registered on each
  selected rail but is not separately NUMA-allocated per rail. Off by default;
  vendor-neutral (sysfs + `sched_getcpu`, no libnuma/CUDA).
- **SGLang HiCache pool-aware v2 interface** (`batch_set_v2`/`batch_get_v2` +
  PoolTransfer) for multi-pool models (Mamba/SWA/DeepSeek-V4).
- **Packaging**: CPack (deb/rpm/tgz) + Dockerfile; **graceful shutdown**; leveled logging.

## Recommended tuning (v2.0)

Validated on a 5-node ring (8×B200 hosts, 6× Gen4 NVMe + 8×400G IB per node,
128 GiB RAM arena): cold read 97 → **156 GB/s**, hot read 48 → **97 GB/s**
single-pair / **147 GB/s** mesh, cold-read p99 0.9–2.2 s → **~50 ms**.
Defaults are safe for a single-fabric node; production overrides below make
fabric selection and capacity explicit.

**Server** (per cache node):

| Knob | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `--rdma-dev` | leave unset for one local HCA; list the fabric explicitly for multi-rail | Unset selects the first `ACTIVE` local HCA (peer names may differ). A comma list opts into multi-rail, anchors only listed active devices, and requires compatible names/fabric on both hosts; inactive entries are rejected. |
| `DFKV_DISK_HASH_WEIGHT` | `10` | Flattens the intra-server disk ring share from ±20 % to ±3 % so the hottest disk stops gating the whole node (+5–6 % cold read, ~2× lower p99). **Re-routes existing keys** (cache miss + refill) — flip together with a restart/upgrade window. |
| `--rdma-depth` | `4` | Set explicitly; the server defaults to 1 and the handshake takes min(client/server). Deeper is not itself a throughput knob. It consumes more slots from the fixed shared receive segment. |
| `--ram-tier` / `--ram-tier-bytes` / `--ram-tier-shards` | on / sized to the node / `16` for ≥100 GiB arenas | Large arenas contend on the shard locks under mixed load (+40 % mixed R/W at 16 shards on a 128 GiB arena); small (≤16 GiB) arenas are fine at the default 8. |
| `--store-engine` | `slab` | Index rebuilds on restart; removes file-per-block hazards. |
| `DFKV_TCP_FIRST_REQ_MS` / `DFKV_MDS_FIRST_REQ_MS` / `DFKV_METRICS_FIRST_REQ_MS` | `30000` (default) / `0` = off | First-request deadline per listener: a connection that sends nothing before the deadline is dropped, capping idle pre-auth connections. |
| `DFKV_METRICS_MAX_CONNS` | `64` (default) | Connection cap on the metrics listener; protects the exporter from connection floods. |

**Production client** (inference connectors, one process per TP rank):

| Knob | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `DFKV_RDMA_DEV` | best: **rail affinity per rank** — inject the matching local/server HCA name per process; simpler on symmetric hosts: the full comma list + `DFKV_RDMA_NUMA=1` | Explicit values are sent to the peer, so verify those names exist on both hosts/containers. Leave unset to let each host select its own first ACTIVE HCA when names differ. |
| `DFKV_RDMA_DEPTH` | `4` | Pairs with the server's posted depth (window = min of both, negotiated). |
| `DFKV_FANOUT_THREADS` | unset (default 32) | Only wide single-process clients (benchmarks, many concurrent Batch* callers) need more. |

**Read-side convoy collapse (v2.0, opt-in)** — for MLA + TP-N inference
rings, where every rank is a separate process fetching the SAME page and the
NVMe otherwise eats N identical reads per page (measured 1:1 disk:wire on a
TP8 replay; with the knobs below: **~2.4 device reads per duplicated page,
repeat reads of promoted pages hit zero disk**):

| Knob | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `DFKV_READ_COALESCE` | `1` | Master switch. Concurrent identical GETs share one disk read (sync + io_uring paths), and a whole-value read with convoy evidence is promoted into the RAM arena as a born-durable resident (zero flush cost, evictable at once). Unset = coalescing/promotion off, restoring the original single-read path. |
| `DFKV_READ_COALESCE_RECUR_MS` | `1000` (default) | Recurrence window: a lone whole read leaves a 64-byte key fingerprint; an identical read inside the window promotes on completion even when rank drift missed the in-flight overlap. Fingerprints, not payloads — widening it costs ~nothing (64 Ki-entry bound). `0` restores the overlap-only gate. |
| `DFKV_READ_COALESCE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `500` (default) | Follower wait bound; a waiter whose leader connection dies falls back to its own read instead of hanging. |

Watch `dfkv_read_coalesce_{leaders,coalesced,recur,timeouts}_total` and
`dfkv_ram_promoted_total`; `timeouts` staying at 0 and `promoted` tracking
`recur` are the healthy signature. Requires the RAM tier (`--ram-tier`) for
promotion; coalescing alone works without it. Note for env-file deployments:
the file is *sourced*, so new knobs must be explicitly **exported** by the
start script or a systemd drop-in to reach the server process.

**Benchmark reproduction** (`dfkv_bench`): `DFKV_RDMA=1` (explicit, or it
silently measures TCP), 8-rail `DFKV_RDMA_DEV`, `DFKV_RDMA_DEPTH=4`,
`DFKV_FANOUT_THREADS=256`; cold-read sweet spot `--threads 16 --batch 8
--size 4194304` per client node. Keep `--count` ≤ the seed's written key count,
and let the drives settle ~10 min after bulk writes before cold-read A/Bs (FTL
GC depresses cold reads ~25 %). The command prints every requested phase report,
then exits `1` if any PUT/GET failed, `2` for invalid CLI usage, and `0` only
when every requested operation succeeded.
